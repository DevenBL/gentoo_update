### Gentoo Updater

The project aims to develop a comprehensive tool for the 
seamless automatic updating of Gentoo Linux. This utility 
will efficiently manage any errors encountered and deliver 
detailed upgrade reports, which will include news and error 
notifications from the latest upgrade, through various channels 
such as email, IRC chat, or a dedicated mobile app.  

By automating and streamlining the often tedious upgrading process, 
the project will significantly enhance the user experience for 
Gentoo Linux users, ultimately saving time and bolstering security.

Key deliverables for this project include:
* system updater program
* ebuild within one of Gentoo's repositories
* push notification mobile application.
